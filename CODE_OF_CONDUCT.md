response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* GitHub repositories and discussions
* Discord servers and community channels
* Twitter and other social media interactions
* Conference presentations and workshops
* Hackathons and developer events
* Community meetups and gatherings

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
