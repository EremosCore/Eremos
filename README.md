Project Contribution â€“ Sample Agent & Documentation Improvements

This update enhances the developer onboarding experience for the Eremos project by introducing a functional sample agent, improving documentation, and providing a clearer, step-by-step setup process.
The goal is to make it faster and easier for new contributors to start building and testing agents.

â¸»

ðŸš€ How It Works

The Sample Agent demonstrates integration with the Eremos core system while logging key runtime events.
It uses the built-in logger utility to output structured logs, enabling better visibility into the execution flow.

Execution Flow:
	1.	The agent initializes and connects to the core system.
	2.	Relevant events are captured and logged in a readable, structured format.
	3.	Developers can observe each step, understand the data flow, and adapt the code for their own agents.

â¸»

ðŸ›  Changes Made
	â€¢	Added Sample Agent
	â€¢	Demonstrates basic usage of the Eremos core
	â€¢	Shows how to integrate logging for better debugging
	â€¢	Improved Documentation
	â€¢	Added step-by-step fork/clone/setup instructions
	â€¢	Included testing & linting commands
	â€¢	Documented PR submission process

**Autonomous swarm agents for early on-chain signal detection**

Eremos is a lightweight framework for deploying modular agents that monitor blockchain activity - tracking wallet clusters, mint patterns, and contract anomalies.
Designed for devs who want low-noise, early signals embedded into their workflows.

**Meet Theron - Agent-000**  
*The first deployed agent in the swarm. Passive. Pattern-sensitive.  
Modular and extendable by design.*


**Agent-001 Coming Soon** [Teaser #1](https://x.com/EremosCore/status/1949154939923833239), [Teaser #2](https://x.com/EremosCore/status/1954856345284567218)

## Features

- **Modular Agents** - Scoped logic for detecting wallet activity, contract spawns, and anomalies  
- **Signal Emission** - Structured signals for logging, alerting, or downstream use  
- **Swarm Design** - Each agent operates independently with shared utilities  
- **Extensible Core** - Plug in watchers, inference layers, or custom triggers  
- **Minimal Output** - Log only what matters
- **Launch Wallet Detection** - Agents can trace freshly funded wallets (e.g. from CEXs), track their contract interactions, and flag high-confidence deploys in real time
- **Ghost Watcher** - Monitors long-dormant wallets that suddenly become active again. Useful for tracing old dev wallets or rug setups.
- *+ More to come.*

## Example Signal

An example signal emitted by an agent detecting a live token deployment:

```ts
[agent-observer] â†’ fresh funding detected from kraken (wallet: 6Yxk...P2M8) at 04:41:12Z
[agent-observer] â†’ contract probing detected within 4s (pump.fun interaction traced)
[agent-observer] â†’ token created at 04:41:17Z (tx: 5gW...pump)
[agent-observer] â†’ 5 bundle-linked wallets interacted within 8s of deploy
[agent-observer] â†’ launch confidence spike (0.91) - emitting signal (elapsed: 13s)

{
  agent: "Observer",
  type: "launch_detected",
  glyph: "Î”",
  hash: "sig_c7f9a3d2bc",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T04:41:25Z",
  source: "agent-observer",
  confidence: 0.91
}
```

---

## Signal Confidence

Each emitted signal includes a `confidence` score (0-1) based on behavioral heuristics:
- CEX-origin funding (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase)
- Time between funding â†’ deploy
- Wallet linkage density (bundled activity)
- Token metadata validation

Confidence is computed via agent-side scoring and logged alongside the signal.


# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Run the sample agent
npm run sample-agent

Eremos Sample Agent

This repository contains the Eremos Sample Agent, a reference implementation demonstrating how to interact with the Eremos platform.
It is designed to be easy to set up, extend, and integrate into larger systems while following best practices for maintainability.

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ Features
	â€¢	TypeScript-based clean architecture.
	â€¢	Logger utility for consistent debugging and error tracking.
	â€¢	Configurable environment variables for seamless setup across environments.
	â€¢	Clear contribution and development guidelines for new contributors.
	â€¢	Well-structured codebase for scalability and clarity.

ðŸ›  Logger Utility

The logger.ts file provides a consistent and professional way to log messages:
                    import logger from './utils/logger';

logger.info('Server started successfully');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('This is an error message');

Output is timestamped and color-coded for better readability in the console.

HOW IT WORKS
	1.	Initialization â€“ The agent loads environment configs and starts services.
	2.	Processing â€“ The logger records system events and data flow.
	3.	Execution â€“ The main service executes API calls or tasks.
	4.	Response Handling â€“ Results are logged and returned to the caller
