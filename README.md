**Autonomous swarm agents for early on-chain signal detection**

Eremos is a lightweight framework for deploying modular agents that monitor blockchain activity - tracking wallet clusters, mint patterns, and contract anomalies.
Designed for devs who want low-noise, early signals embedded into their workflows.

  <em>Theron - Agent (000)</em>
</p>

**Meet Theron - Agent-000**  
*The first deployed agent in the swarm. Passive. Pattern-sensitive.  
Modular and extendable by design.*


**Agent-001 Coming Soon** [Teaser #1](https://x.com/EremosCore/status/1949154939923833239), [Teaser #2](https://x.com/EremosCore/status/1954856345284567218)

## Features

- **Modular Agents** - Scoped logic for detecting wallet activity, contract spawns, and anomalies  
- **Signal Emission** - Structured signals for logging, alerting, or downstream use  
- **Swarm Design** - Each agent operates independently with shared utilities  
- **Extensible Core** - Plug in watchers, inference layers, or custom triggers  
- **Minimal Output** - Log only what matters
- **Launch Wallet Detection** - Agents can trace freshly funded wallets (e.g. from CEXs), track their contract interactions, and flag high-confidence deploys in real time
- **Ghost Watcher** - Monitors long-dormant wallets that suddenly become active again. Useful for tracing old dev wallets or rug setups.
- *+ More to come.*

## Example Signal

An example signal emitted by an agent detecting a live token deployment:

```ts
[agent-observer] → fresh funding detected from kraken (wallet: 6Yxk...P2M8) at 04:41:12Z
[agent-observer] → contract probing detected within 4s (pump.fun interaction traced)
[agent-observer] → token created at 04:41:17Z (tx: 5gW...pump)
[agent-observer] → 5 bundle-linked wallets interacted within 8s of deploy
[agent-observer] → launch confidence spike (0.91) - emitting signal (elapsed: 13s)

{
  agent: "Observer",
  type: "launch_detected",
  glyph: "Δ",
  hash: "sig_c7f9a3d2bc",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T04:41:25Z",
  source: "agent-observer",
  confidence: 0.91
}
```

---

## Signal Confidence

Each emitted signal includes a `confidence` score (0-1) based on behavioral heuristics:
- CEX-origin funding (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase)
- Time between funding → deploy
- Wallet linkage density (bundled activity)
- Token metadata validation

Confidence is computed via agent-side scoring and logged alongside the signal.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript-based agent runner)
- **Language:** TypeScript (typed logic across agents, utils, and infra)
- **Chain Layer:** RPC watchers, mempool filters, native triggers

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EremosCore/Eremos.git
cd Eremos
npm install
```

Set up your environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

## Accessibility & Retail Potential
Eremos is a sharp, lightweight framework for detecting early blockchain signals. But right now, it’s mostly built for developers—people who already know how to navigate RPCs, mempools, and agent logic. That’s fine for now, but it’s also a missed opportunity.

There’s a huge audience of retail users—traders, investors, and crypto-curious folks—who could benefit from the insights Eremos agents provide. The problem is, they’ll never touch it in its current form. No UI, no onboarding, no way to interpret signals unless you’re already deep in the weeds.

## What’s Holding It Back
The CLI setup is intimidating for non-technical users.

Signals are powerful but hard to interpret without context.

There’s no visual layer—no dashboard, no alerts, no mobile experience.

## Why This Matters
Retail users make up the bulk of crypto activity. If Eremos were easier to use, it could:

Reach a much wider audience

Generate more signals and data

Create new monetization paths (subscriptions, analytics, integrations)

## What Could Help
Here are a few ideas that could make Eremos more accessible and scalable:

A simple web interface with wallet login and signal visualization

Real-time dashboards showing confidence scores and wallet activity

Push notifications for key events like contract deployments or wallet funding

Guided onboarding with presets and tooltips

Integration with swap protocols so users can act on signals directly

## The Bigger Picture
Eremos has the potential to be more than a dev tool. With the right UX layer, it could become a go-to intelligence platform for everyday crypto users—helping them make smarter decisions and stay ahead of the curve.
