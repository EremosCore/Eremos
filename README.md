## What is Eremos?

**Eremos is a modular framework for deploying autonomous ‚Äúswarm agents‚Äù that monitor on-chain activity across the Solana ecosystem.**  
These agents run independently, observe funding flows, bundling behavior, deploy patterns, and more‚Äîsurfacing early signals before they‚Äôre obvious.

Built as a public good, Eremos aims to enhance transparency and insight across Solana.  
It‚Äôs fully open-source, easily extendable, and designed to plug into dev or analyst workflows.

## Why Eremos?

- **Early Signal Detection:** Get actionable insights before they‚Äôre obvious to the broader ecosystem.
- **Transparency:** Open-source and public-good ethos for the Solana community.
- **Modularity:** Easily extend or create new agents for custom monitoring needs.
- **Plug & Play:** Integrates into developer and analyst workflows with minimal setup.

---

## Use Cases

- **Token Launch Monitoring:** Detect new token launches and associated wallet activity in real time.
- **CEX Funding Tracing:** Track wallets funded from centralized exchanges and their subsequent on-chain actions.
- **Dormant Wallet Alerts:** Get notified when long-inactive wallets become active again.
- **Contract Anomaly Detection:** Surface unusual contract deployments or interactions.
- **Bundle Activity Tracking:** Identify clusters of wallets acting in coordination.

## Features

- **Modular Agents** ‚Äì Scoped logic for detecting wallet activity, contract spawns, and anomalies  
- **Signal Emission** ‚Äì Structured signals for logging, alerting, or downstream use  
- **Swarm Design** ‚Äì Each agent operates independently with shared utilities  
- **Extensible Core** ‚Äì Plug in watchers, inference layers, or custom triggers  
- **Minimal Output** ‚Äì Log only what matters  
- **Launch Wallet Detection** ‚Äì Agents can trace freshly funded wallets (e.g. from CEXs), track their contract interactions, and flag high-confidence deploys in real time  
- **Ghost Watcher** ‚Äì Monitors long-dormant wallets that suddenly become active again. Useful for tracing old dev wallets or rug setups.

## Example Signal

An example signal emitted by an agent detecting a live token deployment:

```ts
[agent-observer] ‚Üí fresh funding detected from kraken (wallet: 6Yxk...P2M8) at 04:41:12Z
[agent-observer] ‚Üí contract probing detected within 4s (pump.fun interaction traced)
[agent-observer] ‚Üí token created at 04:41:17Z (tx: 5gW...pump)
[agent-observer] ‚Üí 5 bundle-linked wallets interacted within 8s of deploy
[agent-observer] ‚Üí launch confidence spike (0.91) - emitting signal (elapsed: 13s)

{
  agent: "Observer",
  type: "launch_detected",
  glyph: "Œî",
  hash: "sig_c7f9a3d2bc",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T04:41:25Z",
  source: "agent-observer",
  confidence: 0.91
}
```

---

## Signal Confidence

Each emitted signal includes a `confidence` score (0-1) based on behavioral heuristics:
- CEX-origin funding (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase)
- Time between funding ‚Üí deploy
- Wallet linkage density (bundled activity)
- Token metadata validation

Confidence is computed via agent-side scoring and logged alongside the signal.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript-based agent runner)
- **Language:** TypeScript (typed logic across agents, utils, and infra)
- **Chain Layer:** RPC watchers, mempool filters, native triggers

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EremosCore/Eremos.git
cd Eremos
npm install
```

Set up your environment:
