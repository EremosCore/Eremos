## Running the Sample Agent

This project includes a sample agent to demonstrate how modular agents work within the Eremos framework, complete with structured logging and clear execution flow.

### How to Run

1. Make sure Node.js and TypeScript are installed on your machine.

2. If not already done, install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the sample agent using:

```bash
npx ts-node agents/sampleAgent.ts
```

You should see timestamped logs detailing agent startup, signal processing, and completion status.

## Logging

Logging is centralized in `utils/logger.ts` and provides:

* `logSignal(signal)` for structured signal output with clear metadata.
* A simple `logger` object exposing `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug` methods for consistent, timestamped console output.
* A lightweight, dependency-free design ensuring compatibility across environments.

# Pull Request Description

### Overview

This pull request introduces a working sample agent and a unified logging utility, bringing clarity and structure to the codebase:

* Adds `agents/sampleAgent.ts`, showcasing a modular agent with example signal detection and detailed logging.
* Implements `utils/logger.ts`, providing consistent and timestamped logging methods without relying on external libraries.
* Enhances developer experience by including straightforward instructions on running the sample agent.
* Lays groundwork for future extensibility and easier maintenance through clean code organization.

### Benefits

By including a ready-to-run agent and professional logging, this contribution helps new contributors get started quickly, improves debugging and visibility, and raises the overall polish of the repository — making it more appealing for ongoing development and bounty evaluation.
