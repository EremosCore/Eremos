Project Contribution â€“ Sample Agent & Documentation Improvements

This update enhances the developer onboarding experience for the Eremos project by introducing a functional sample agent, improving documentation, and providing a clearer, step-by-step setup process.
The goal is to make it faster and easier for new contributors to start building and testing agents.

â¸»

ðŸš€ How It Works

The Sample Agent demonstrates integration with the Eremos core system while logging key runtime events.
It uses the built-in logger utility to output structured logs, enabling better visibility into the execution flow.

Execution Flow:
	1.	The agent initializes and connects to the core system.
	2.	Relevant events are captured and logged in a readable, structured format.
	3.	Developers can observe each step, understand the data flow, and adapt the code for their own agents.

Eremos Sample Agent

This repository contains the Eremos Sample Agent, a reference implementation demonstrating how to interact with the Eremos platform.
It is designed to be easy to set up, extend, and integrate into larger systems while following best practices for maintainability.

ðŸ“Œ Features
	â€¢	TypeScript-based clean architecture.
	â€¢	Logger utility for consistent debugging and error tracking.
	â€¢	Configurable environment variables for seamless setup across environments.
	â€¢	Clear contribution and development guidelines for new contributors.
	â€¢	Well-structured codebase for scalability and clarity.

ðŸ›  Logger Utility

The logger.ts file provides a consistent and professional way to log messages:
                    import logger from './utils/logger';

logger.info('Server started successfully');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('This is an error message');

Output is timestamped and color-coded for better readability in the console.

                        Project Structure
Eremos/
â”‚â”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logger.ts    # Logger utility
â”‚â”€â”€ .env.example         # Example environment variables
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md            # Documentation
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json

HOW IT WORKS
	1.	Initialization â€“ The agent loads environment configs and starts services.
	2.	Processing â€“ The logger records system events and data flow.
	3.	Execution â€“ The main service executes API calls or tasks.
	4.	Response Handling â€“ Results are logged and returned to the caller
