- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 🕐 Response Timeline

- Public acknowledgment (with permission)
- Inclusion in our security hall of fame
- Potential bounty rewards for significant discoveries

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly
3. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, keys, or credentials
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Keep your `.env` files secure and never share them
2. **Updates**: Keep Eremos updated to the latest version
3. **Network Security**: Use secure networks when running agents
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to agent systems and logs

## 🔍 Security Considerations for Agents

### Agent Development

- **Isolation**: Agents should operate in isolated environments
- **Minimal Permissions**: Grant agents only necessary permissions
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all external data inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for external API calls
- **Logging**: Log security-relevant events without exposing sensitive data

### Signal Security

- **Data Validation**: Validate all signal data before processing
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive signal data
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for signal consumption
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain audit trails for signal processing

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Framework Limitations

1. **Agent Isolation**: Agents currently share the same runtime environment
2. **Signal Validation**: Basic signal validation is implemented
3. **Rate Limiting**: No built-in rate limiting for agent operations
4. **Access Control**: No fine-grained access control system

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Agent sandboxing and isolation
- [ ] Advanced signal validation and sanitization  
- [ ] Built-in rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Role-based access control system
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Security-focused CI/CD checks

## 📋 Security Checklist for Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation is implemented where applicable
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and security-audited
- [ ] Code follows secure coding practices
- [ ] Documentation includes security considerations

## 🔄 Security Updates

We will publish security advisories for:

- Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- High-severity vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9)  
- Vulnerabilities affecting agent integrity
- Vulnerabilities affecting signal authenticity
