# Contributing to Eremos

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Eremos! This guide will help you get started with making meaningful contributions to our autonomous agent framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git
- TypeScript knowledge (recommended)
- Basic understanding of blockchain/Solana (helpful but not required)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Eremos.git
   cd Eremos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

4. **Set up your environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

## Making Changes

### Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript First**: Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Formatting**: Code is automatically formatted with Prettier
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and files
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, especially in agent detection algorithms

### Testing

Before submitting changes:

```bash
# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Run tests for specific component
npm test -- --testNamePattern="YourComponent"

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lint:fix

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples:
git commit -m "feat: add launch detection to observer agent"
git commit -m "fix: resolve signal confidence calculation bug"
git commit -m "docs: update agent architecture documentation"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for signal processor"

# Use conventional commit prefixes:
# feat: new features
# fix: bug fixes
# docs: documentation changes
# test: adding or updating tests
# refactor: code refactoring
# style: formatting changes
# chore: maintenance tasks
```
