Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please read `docs/contributing.md` for the full guidelines, including development workflow, code standards, and how to propose changes.

Quick checklist:

- Use TypeScript and follow the patterns in `agents/example.ts`.
- Run static checks locally:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run format:check`
  - `npm run typecheck`
- Add/adjust tests under `tests/` when changing logic.
- Update docs/README if behavior or APIs change.
