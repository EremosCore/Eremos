# Contributing to Eremos

We welcome contributions—especially new agents and documentation improvements.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Use a short, meaningful branch name (e.g., `lore`, `docs-signals`, `agent-observer-tuning`).
3. Make focused changes and keep edits small and cohesive.
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description.

## Commit style
- Use concise, imperative commit messages: `docs: expand signal schema examples`, `agents: add launch tracker confidence notes`.
- Prefer multiple small commits over one large commit.

## PR expectations
- Scope: keep PRs focused (docs‑only PRs are welcome and encouraged).
- Include context on why the change helps users or contributors.
- Link to related docs or issues when relevant.

## Docs checks
- Headings are consistent (`#`, `##`, etc.).
- Tables render correctly on GitHub.
- Code fences use proper languages (e.g., `ts`, `json`, `bash`).
- Images have alt text and reasonable width in README.

## Development helpers
- Explore `/scripts` for dev aids like `dev-agent.ts`, `generate-signal.ts`, and `validate-agent.ts`.

Thank you for contributing to the swarm.
