# Glyphs

Each Eremos agent uses a symbolic glyph to identify its signature in logs and signals.

| Glyph | Agent     | Meaning            |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Ϸ     | Theron    | Memory / Echo      |
| Δ     | Observer  | Detection / Signal |
| λ     | Harvester | Flow / Indexing    |

Glyphs are used in:

- `logSignal()`
- visualizations
- agent memory logs
- - more to come
