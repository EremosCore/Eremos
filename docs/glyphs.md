# Glyphs

Each Eremos agent uses a symbolic glyph to identify its signature in logs and signals.

| Glyph | Agent         | Meaning                |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Ϸ     | Theron        | Memory / Echo          |
| Δ     | Observer      | Detection / Signal     |
| λ     | Harvester     | Flow / Indexing        |
| Σ     | LaunchTracker | Launch / Monitoring    |
| ψ     | Skieró        | Dormant / Reactivation |

Glyphs are used in:

- `logSignal()`
- visualizations
- agent memory logs
